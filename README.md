# FluxArchitectures
Complex neural network examples for Flux.jl.

When I started to dig into `Flux.jl`, almost all the examples I could find only presented small neural networks, or networks comprised of standard building bricks. This repository contains a loose collection of (slightly) more advanced network architectures, mostly centered around time series forecasting.
